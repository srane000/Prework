Android Prework- Good Day

By: Siddharth Rane

Good Day is an app that displays different messages everytime you click the button.

Certain features in this app include:
- An introductory page with an image, the title of the app and a button that leads to a second activity page
- The next button is available to press and has another image in the background
- The following button prints out random fortune statements about what may happen

*Keep in mind that the extra features have been added purely for my own learning and knowledge in an attempt to have the button display randoms prompts whenever clicked

Here is the walkthrough of the features

Challenges Faced:
I faced several challenges at almost every step. I had Android Studio downloaded a long time ago but I had to get the latest version to fix issues that were arising such as the gradle build issues. Once my platform was complete I started to get all the basics done first such as UI and functionality of button. Going above and beyond I then attempted to make a transition between one activity to another through the button which required the use of the Intent class. The new activity page has another button which prints out the toast message. However, to change it up I wanted to randomly generate a couple of random messages so that each time you click, there is a new message associated with it. This was possible through creating a list and using the random class to make it happen. Finally git gave me major problems on my local machine and hence I had to use the terminal to access the different branches rather than using android studio in built functionality which I personally feel is more difficult to use.
