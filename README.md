Android Prework- Good Day

By: Siddharth Rane

Good Day is an app that displays different messages everytime you click the button.

Certain features in this app include:
- An introductory page with an image, the title of the app and a button that leads to a second activity page
- The next button is available to press and has another image in the background
- The following button prints out random fortune statements about what may happen

*Keep in mind that the extra features have been added purely for my own learning and knowledge in an attempt to have the button display randoms prompts whenever clicked
